In the site feedly.com there are many keyboard shortcuts, for example, "R" - is "Refresh" of part of page, renewing of list of records. Unfortunately, there is bug in any national keyboard layout. It catch keyboard letter, but not key code. Script fix it and add such partial refresh by Ctrl-F5 or Shift-F5.
